## A VOIR

Sur la Mars, la reprise sur coupure de courant semble relancer automatiquement l'impression depuis le début et donc gros risque d'abimer l'imprimante / l'écran.  
Un systeme d'onduleur avec batterie de secours semble être a envisager si le firmware n'est pas corigé  ...


Jake Maverick
> Looks lovely! But I just had an awful thought....I only have a Mars, but there's been a couple of times where the power has glitched mid print..and when the power comes back on it tries to print from the beginning/ start again...fortunately I have always been able to catch it in time...but if that happens on the Jupiter it's going to be wrecked machine + a serious mess to clean up...anybody know if the firmware been re-written to NOT do that?

> The best situation for power outages is to use a UPS with the printers. I go to the local E-Recycler and buy them with dead batteries, then extend the battery wires out of the unit, and wire to a deep cycle battery used for trolling motors for long term printing if the power is out for a while.
